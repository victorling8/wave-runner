# wave-runner
This is the source code for my Android app, Wave Runner, which I developed over two months during my first co-op term. 

I decided to make this app because I think that making games is one of the most fun ways of developing software skills, and I wanted to re-enforce the concepts that I learned during my co-op term.

The Java files that control the logic of the entire app are located in WaveRunner/app/src/main/java/waverunner/example/victorling8/waverunner organized by package.

The resource files (including images and layout markup files) are located in WaveRunner/app/src/main/res in their respective subfolders. An interesting tidbit is that I created the vast majority of the images (such as the various enemies) in PowerPoint. Why fix what isn't broken?

Some possible improvements could include global highscore sharing and adaptive frame rate, and I might look into these at some point in the future.
